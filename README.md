# Market-point-of-sale
A program that demonstrate a simple point-of-sale (POS) program, drawing inspiration from the cashiers we encounter during our day-to-day shopping purchases. 
It allows the user to enter the barcode for each product, and calculate the total for all items in the cart.
Our program explores:
How data files are processed by C programs
How to read data using sequential-access file processing.
How to apply C file processing to real-world systems (like markets, shopping centers, etc)
